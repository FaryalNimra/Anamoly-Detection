Anomaly Detection
This Notebook focuses on implementing anomaly detection techniques using machine learning and statistical methods. Anomaly detection is crucial in many fields such as fraud detection, industrial monitoring, cybersecurity, and more.

📁 Project Overview
This task is part of a larger series related to data preprocessing and analysis. In this notebook, we aim to:

Understand and visualize anomalies in datasets.

Apply different techniques for anomaly detection.

Compare and evaluate the results of these techniques.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

📌 Features
Loading and preprocessing of data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Application of the following anomaly detection methods:

Z-Score method

IQR (Interquartile Range) method

Isolation Forest

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Visualization of detected anomalies

Evaluation of results

🧪 How to Run
